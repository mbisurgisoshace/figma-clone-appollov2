# Appollo - Figma Clone Exercise

Figma clone application, with most common features of a canvas app, like zooming, panning, drawing shapes, text, etc. It includes multi-user collaboration as well as real time collaboration.
The idea is that we see what we can accomplish with this demo, and how much we can use as either a base, or for ideas for the Appollo Builder, and maybe once we have the final demo, try to extend it with some of Appollo use cases. 

The example application came from a YouTube tutorial:
